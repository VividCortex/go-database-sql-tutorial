title: Retrieving Result Sets
---

There are several idiomatic operations to retrieve results from the datastore.

1. Execute a query that returns rows.
1. Prepare a statement for repeated use, execute it multiple times, and destroy it.
1. Execute a statement in a once-off fashion, without preparing it for repeated use.
1. Execute a query that returns a single row. There is a shortcut for this special case.

Go's `database/sql` function names are significant. **If a function name
includes `Query`, it is designed to ask a question of the database, and will
return a set of rows**, even if it's empty. Statements that don't return rows
should not use `Query` functions; they should use `Exec()`.

Fetching Data from the Database
===============================

Let's take a look at an example of how to query the database, working with
results. We'll query the `users` table for a user whose `id` is 1, and print out
the user's `id` and `name`.  We will assign results to variables, a row at a
time, with `rows.Scan()`.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go">
var (
	id int
	name string
)
rows, err := db.Query("select id, name from users where id = ?", 1)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer rows.Close()
for rows.Next() {
	err := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;name)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Println(id, name)
}
err = rows.Err()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
</pre>

Here's what's happening in the above code:

1. We're using `db.Query()` to send the query to the database. We check the error, as usual.
2. We defer `rows.Close()`. This is very important.
3. We iterate over the rows with `rows.Next()`.
4. We read the columns in each row into variables with `rows.Scan()`.
5. We check for errors after we're done iterating over the rows.

This is pretty much the only way to do it in Go. You can't
get a row as a map, for example. That's because everything is strongly typed.
You need to create variables of the correct type and pass pointers to them, as
shown.

A couple parts of this are easy to get wrong, and can have bad consequences.

* You should always check for an error at the end of the `for rows.Next()`
  loop. If there's an error during the loop, you need to know about it. Don't
  just assume that the loop iterates until you've processed all the rows.
* Second, as long as there's an open result set (represented by `rows`), the
  underlying connection is busy and can't be used for any other query. That
  means it's not available in the connection pool. If you iterate over all of
  the rows with `rows.Next()`, eventually you'll read the last row, and
  `rows.Next()` will encounter an internal EOF error and call `rows.Close()` for
  you. But if for some reason you exit that loop -- an early return, or so on --
  then the `rows` doesn't get closed, and the connection remains open. (It is
  auto-closed if `rows.Next()` returns false due to an error, though). This is
  an easy way to run out of resources.
* `rows.Close()` is a harmless no-op if it's already closed, so you can call
  it multiple times. Notice, however, that we check the error first, and only
  call `rows.Close()` if there isn't an error, in order to avoid a runtime panic.
  For example, if `rows` is `nil`, `defer rows.Close()` will cause a nil pointer dereference panic after the function exits.
* You should **always `defer rows.Close()`**, even if you also call `rows.Close()`
  explicitly at the end of the loop, which isn't a bad idea. 
* Don't `defer` within a loop. A deferred statement doesn't get executed until
  the function exits, so a long-running function shouldn't use it. If you do,
  you will slowly accumulate memory. If you are repeatedly querying and
  consuming result sets within a loop, you should explicitly call `rows.Close()`
  when you're done with each result, and not use `defer`.

How Scan() Works
================

When you iterate over rows and scan them into destination variables, Go performs data
type conversions work for you, behind the scenes. It is based on the type of the
destination variable. Being aware of this can clean up your code and help avoid
repetitive work.

For example, suppose you select some rows from a table that is defined with
string columns, such as `VARCHAR(45)` or similar. You happen to know, however,
that the table always contains numbers. If you pass a pointer to a string, Go
will copy the bytes into the string. Now you can use `strconv.ParseInt()` or
similar to convert the value to a number. You'll have to check for errors in the
SQL operations, as well as errors parsing the integer. This is messy and
tedious.

Or, you can just pass `Scan()` a pointer to an integer. Go will detect that and
call `strconv.ParseInt()` for you. If there's an error in conversion, the call
to `Scan()` will return it. Your code is neater and smaller now. This is the
recommended way to use `database/sql`.

Preparing Queries
=================

You should, in general, always prepare queries to be used multiple times. The
result of preparing the query is a prepared statement, which can have
placeholders (a.k.a. bind values) for parameters that you'll provide when you
execute the statement.  This is much better than concatenating strings, for all
the usual reasons (avoiding SQL injection attacks, for example).

In MySQL, the parameter placeholder is `?`, and in PostgreSQL it is `$N`, where
N is a number. SQLite accepts either of these.  In Oracle placeholders begin with
a colon and are named, like `:param1`. We'll use `?` because we're using MySQL
as our example.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go">
stmt, err := db.Prepare("select id, name from users where id = ?")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer stmt.Close()
rows, err := stmt.Query(1)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer rows.Close()
for rows.Next() {
	// ...
}
if err = rows.Err(); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
</pre>

Under the hood, `db.Query()` actually prepares, executes, and closes a prepared
statement. That's three round-trips to the database. If you're not careful, you
can triple the number of database interactions your application makes! Some
drivers can avoid this in specific cases,
but not all drivers do. See [prepared statements](prepared.html) for more.

Single-Row Queries
==================

If a query returns at most one row, you can use a shortcut around some of the
lengthy boilerplate code:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go">
var name string
err = db.QueryRow("select name from users where id = ?", 1).Scan(&amp;name)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(name)
</pre>

Errors from the query are deferred until `Scan()` is called, and then are
returned from that. You can also call `QueryRow()` on a prepared statement:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go">
stmt, err := db.Prepare("select name from users where id = ?")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer stmt.Close()
var name string
err = stmt.QueryRow(1).Scan(&amp;name)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(name)
</pre>

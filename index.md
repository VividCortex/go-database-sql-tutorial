title: Go database/sql tutorial
---

The idiomatic way to use a SQL, or SQL-like, database in Go is through the
[database/sql package](http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/).  It provides a
lightweight interface to a row-oriented database. This website is a
reference for the most common aspects of how to use it.

Why is this needed? The package's documentation tells you what everything does,
but it doesn't tell you how to use the package. Many of us find ourselves
wishing for a quick-reference and a "getting started" orientation that tells
stories instead of listing facts. Contributions are welcome; please send pull
requests [here](https://github.com/VividCortex/go-database-sql-tutorial).

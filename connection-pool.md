title: The Connection Pool
---

There is a basic connection pool in the `database/sql` package. There isn't a
lot of ability to control or inspect it, but here are some things you might find
useful to know:

* Connection pooling means that executing two consecutive statements on a single database might open two connections and execute them separately. It is fairly common for programmers to be confused as to why their code misbehaves. For example, `LOCK TABLES` followed by an `INSERT` can block because the `INSERT` is on a connection that does not hold the table lock.
* Connections are created when needed and there isn't a free connection in the pool.
* By default, there's no limit on the number of connections. If you try to do a lot of things at once, you can create an arbitrary number of connections. This can cause the database to return an error such as "too many connections."
* In Go 1.1 or newer, you can use `db.SetMaxIdleConns(N)` to limit the number of *idle* connections in the pool. This doesn't limit the pool size, though.
* In Go 1.2.1 or newer, you can use `db.SetMaxOpenConns(N)` to limit the number of *total* open connections to the database. Unfortunately, a [deadlock bug](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/jOTqHxI09ns/x79ajll-ab4J) ([fix](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=8a7ac002f840)) prevents `db.SetMaxOpenConns(N)` from safely being used in 1.2.
* Connections are recycled rather fast. Setting a high number of idle connections with `db.SetMaxIdleConns(N)` can reduce this churn, and help keep connections around for reuse.
* Keeping a connection idle for a long time can cause problems (like in [this issue](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/issues/257) with MySQL on Microsoft Azure). Try `db.SetMaxIdleConns(0)` if you get connection timeouts because a connection is idle for too long.
